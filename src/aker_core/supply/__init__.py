Aker Core Supply Module

This module provides supply constraint calculators for the Aker Property Model,
including elasticity, vacancy, and lease-up time-on-market calculations.

The module implements the supply constraint pillar of the Aker scoring system,
which measures market supply constraints through building permit activity,
vacancy rates, and lease-up dynamics.
