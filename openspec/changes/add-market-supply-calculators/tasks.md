## 1. Module Architecture
- [ ] 1.1 Create `src/aker_core/supply/` module with proper package structure
- [ ] 1.2 Set up module imports and dependencies (numpy, pandas, typing)
- [ ] 1.3 Create `__init__.py` with public API exports and version tracking
- [ ] 1.4 Add comprehensive type hints and documentation standards

## 2. Elasticity Calculator Implementation
- [ ] 2.1 Implement `supply.elasticity(permits, households, years=3)` function
- [ ] 2.2 Add 3-year rolling average calculation for building permits per 1,000 households
- [ ] 2.3 Implement inverse scoring logic (lower elasticity = higher constraint score)
- [ ] 2.4 Add data validation for permit and household data consistency
- [ ] 2.5 Handle edge cases (zero households, negative permits, missing data)

## 3. Vacancy Rate Calculator
- [ ] 3.1 Implement `supply.vacancy(hud_data, msa_boundaries)` function
- [ ] 3.2 Add HUD vacancy data processing with proper geographic aggregation
- [ ] 3.3 Implement vacancy rate normalization and outlier handling
- [ ] 3.4 Add inverse scoring logic (lower vacancy = higher constraint score)
- [ ] 3.5 Support multiple vacancy rate types (rental, multi-family, overall)

## 4. Lease-Up Time-on-Market Calculator
- [ ] 4.1 Implement `supply.leaseup_tom(lease_data, property_filters)` function
- [ ] 4.2 Add multi-family lease-up time-on-market calculation
- [ ] 4.3 Implement property type filtering and geographic aggregation
- [ ] 4.4 Add inverse scoring logic (shorter lease-up = higher constraint score)
- [ ] 4.5 Handle data quality issues and missing lease-up information

## 5. Database Integration
- [ ] 5.1 Design database migration for enhanced `market_supply` table
- [ ] 5.2 Add fields for calculated metrics with proper data types and constraints
- [ ] 5.3 Create data access layer with CRUD operations for supply metrics
- [ ] 5.4 Implement efficient indexing for MSA and time-based queries
- [ ] 5.5 Add data lineage tracking for auditability

## 6. Great Expectations Validation
- [ ] 6.1 Create GE expectation suite for supply metric data quality
- [ ] 6.2 Add range validations for elasticity, vacancy, and lease-up metrics
- [ ] 6.3 Implement reasonableness checks for inverse scoring relationships
- [ ] 6.4 Add geographic consistency validations across MSAs
- [ ] 6.5 Create data drift detection for supply metrics over time

## 7. Testing Suite
- [ ] 7.1 Create comprehensive `tests/core/test_supply_calculators.py` test module
- [ ] 7.2 Implement unit tests for each calculator function with edge cases
- [ ] 7.3 Add property-based tests for mathematical correctness (inverse relationships)
- [ ] 7.4 Create golden-master tests with sample MSA datasets
- [ ] 7.5 Add integration tests with database persistence
- [ ] 7.6 Implement performance benchmarks for large-scale calculations

## 8. Documentation & Developer Experience
- [ ] 8.1 Add comprehensive docstrings with mathematical formulas
- [ ] 8.2 Document inverse scoring logic and rationale for each metric
- [ ] 8.3 Create usage examples and integration guides
- [ ] 8.4 Add API reference documentation with parameter specifications
- [ ] 8.5 Create troubleshooting guide for common data quality issues

## 9. Integration & Workflow
- [ ] 9.1 Connect supply calculators with existing ETL pipelines
- [ ] 9.2 Integrate with market scoring workflow for automated calculation
- [ ] 9.3 Add monitoring and alerting for data quality issues
- [ ] 9.4 Implement caching layer for frequently accessed supply metrics
- [ ] 9.5 Create export functionality for Excel/Word integration

## 10. Validation & Quality Assurance
- [ ] 10.1 Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] 10.2 Validate against known market benchmarks and historical data
- [ ] 10.3 Cross-validate calculations with alternative data sources
- [ ] 10.4 Performance testing with large datasets (all US MSAs)
- [ ] 10.5 End-to-end validation with complete supply scoring pipeline
