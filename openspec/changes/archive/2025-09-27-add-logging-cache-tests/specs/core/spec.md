## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Logging Metrics Validation
Structured logging MUST include unit tests covering labeled timing metrics, error taxonomy fields, and Prometheus endpoint helpers to ensure observability features remain intact.

#### Scenario: Timing Helper Emits Labeled Histogram
- **WHEN** a timing helper wraps a function with labels
- **THEN** the histogram metric SHALL contain a sample with matching label values and incremented count

#### Scenario: Metrics Endpoint Helper Emits Exposition
- **WHEN** Prometheus helpers are invoked in tests with mocked dependencies
- **THEN** the metrics registry SHALL be exposed without raising errors

#### Scenario: Error Taxonomy Fields Logged
- **WHEN** an error is classified and logged with an exception
- **THEN** the structured log SHALL contain `error_type`, `error_code`, `category`, and `severity`

### Requirement: Cache Storage Tests
Cache storage MUST have regression tests covering base-path inference, environment overrides, and JSON metadata persistence.

#### Scenario: Cache Respects Environment Override
- **WHEN** `AKER_CACHE_PATH` is set and `Cache` is instantiated without a base path
- **THEN** files SHALL be written beneath the override directory

#### Scenario: JSON Data Stores Metadata
- **WHEN** JSON-like data is stored without specifying `data_type`
- **THEN** the system SHALL store the payload and metadata with `data_type="json"`

### Requirement: Deployment Smoke Test
Prefect deployment definitions MUST have a smoke test that instantiates each deployment and validates schedule/work pool configuration.

#### Scenario: Deployment Definitions Load
- **WHEN** deployments are imported in tests
- **THEN** each deployment SHALL expose a serialized representation without raising exceptions
