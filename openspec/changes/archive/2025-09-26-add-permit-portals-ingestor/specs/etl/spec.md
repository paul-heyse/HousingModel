- **AND** preserves source-specific metadata

### Requirement: Rate Limiting and Error Handling
The system MUST handle rate limiting and errors gracefully during data collection.

#### Scenario: API rate limiting
- **WHEN** hitting API rate limits
- **THEN** implements exponential backoff with jitter
- **AND** respects retry-after headers
- **AND** queues requests for later processing

#### Scenario: Connection failures
- **WHEN** network or server issues occur
- **THEN** implements retry logic with circuit breaker pattern
- **AND** logs failures with appropriate severity
- **AND** continues with available data

#### Scenario: Data parsing errors
- **WHEN** encountering malformed data
- **THEN** logs specific parsing errors
- **AND** skips invalid records with proper error tracking
- **AND** maintains data collection progress

### Requirement: Great Expectations Validation
The system MUST validate collected permit data using Great Expectations.

#### Scenario: Date coverage validation
- **WHEN** validating collected permits
- **THEN** ensures adequate date coverage within the 3-year window
- **AND** identifies gaps in data collection
- **AND** flags insufficient coverage for manual review

#### Scenario: Data completeness validation
- **WHEN** validating permit records
- **THEN** ensures required fields are present and valid
- **AND** validates data types and ranges
- **AND** checks for reasonable value distributions

#### Scenario: Geographic consistency
- **WHEN** validating spatial data
- **THEN** ensures coordinates are within expected ranges
- **AND** validates address geocoding accuracy
- **AND** checks for spatial data quality issues

### Requirement: ETL Flow Integration
The system MUST integrate with existing ETL orchestration and data storage.

#### Scenario: Prefect flow integration
- **WHEN** running permit collection
- **THEN** executes as Prefect flows with proper scheduling
- **AND** supports both one-time and recurring collection
- **AND** integrates with existing validation and storage flows

#### Scenario: Data lake storage
- **WHEN** storing collected permits
- **THEN** stores in data lake with proper partitioning

- **AND** supports efficient querying and analysis

#### Scenario: Incremental processing
- **WHEN** processing updates
- **THEN** identifies new and modified permits
- **AND** updates existing records appropriately
- **AND** maintains historical data integrity

### Requirement: Monitoring and Alerting
The system MUST provide monitoring and alerting for data collection health.

#### Scenario: Collection success monitoring
- **WHEN** data collection completes
- **THEN** reports success rates and data volumes
- **AND** tracks collection performance metrics
- **AND** alerts on significant failures or data quality issues

#### Scenario: Data freshness monitoring
- **WHEN** monitoring data pipeline health
- **THEN** tracks data freshness and update frequency
- **AND** alerts when data becomes stale
- **AND** provides visibility into collection pipeline status

#### Scenario: Error tracking and analysis
