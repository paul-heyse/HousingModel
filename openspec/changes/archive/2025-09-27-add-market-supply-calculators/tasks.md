## 2. Elasticity Calculator Implementation
- [x] 2.1 Implement `supply.elasticity(permits, households, years=3)` function
- [x] 2.2 Add 3-year rolling average calculation for building permits per 1,000 households
- [x] 2.3 Implement inverse scoring logic (lower elasticity = higher constraint score)
- [x] 2.4 Add data validation for permit and household data consistency
- [x] 2.5 Handle edge cases (zero households, negative permits, missing data)

## 3. Vacancy Rate Calculator
- [x] 3.1 Implement `supply.vacancy(hud_data, msa_boundaries)` function
- [x] 3.2 Add HUD vacancy data processing with proper geographic aggregation
- [x] 3.3 Implement vacancy rate normalization and outlier handling
- [x] 3.4 Add inverse scoring logic (lower vacancy = higher constraint score)
- [x] 3.5 Support multiple vacancy rate types (rental, multi-family, overall)

## 4. Lease-Up Time-on-Market Calculator
- [x] 4.1 Implement `supply.leaseup_tom(lease_data, property_filters)` function
- [x] 4.2 Add multi-family lease-up time-on-market calculation
- [x] 4.3 Implement property type filtering and geographic aggregation
- [x] 4.4 Add inverse scoring logic (shorter lease-up = higher constraint score)
- [x] 4.5 Handle data quality issues and missing lease-up information

## 5. Database Integration
- [x] 5.1 Design database migration for enhanced `market_supply` table
- [x] 5.2 Add fields for calculated metrics with proper data types and constraints
- [x] 5.3 Create data access layer with CRUD operations for supply metrics
- [x] 5.4 Implement efficient indexing for MSA and time-based queries
- [x] 5.5 Add data lineage tracking for auditability

## 6. Great Expectations Validation
- [x] 6.1 Create GE expectation suite for supply metric data quality
- [x] 6.2 Add range validations for elasticity, vacancy, and lease-up metrics
- [x] 6.3 Implement reasonableness checks for inverse scoring relationships
- [x] 6.4 Add geographic consistency validations across MSAs
- [x] 6.5 Create data drift detection for supply metrics over time

## 7. Testing Suite

- [x] 7.2 Implement unit tests for each calculator function with edge cases
- [x] 7.3 Add property-based tests for mathematical correctness (inverse relationships)
- [x] 7.4 Create golden-master tests with sample MSA datasets
- [x] 7.5 Add integration tests with database persistence
- [x] 7.6 Implement performance benchmarks for large-scale calculations
