### Requirement: Coverage and Completeness Validation
The system MUST validate data coverage and completeness requirements.

#### Scenario: Geographic coverage validation
- **WHEN** validating spatial datasets
- **THEN** geographic coverage meets business requirements

- **AND** data gaps are flagged for investigation

#### Scenario: Record completeness validation
- **WHEN** validating individual records
- **THEN** required fields are present and non-null
- **AND** completeness thresholds are met
- **AND** missing data is quantified and reported

### Requirement: Prefect Integration for Validation
The system MUST integrate Great Expectations validation into Prefect flows.

#### Scenario: Validation task execution
- **WHEN** a Prefect flow processes data
- **THEN** validation tasks run automatically
- **AND** validation results determine flow success/failure
- **AND** validation metrics are logged and monitored

#### Scenario: Validation failure handling
- **WHEN** validation expectations fail
- **THEN** appropriate actions are taken based on severity
- **AND** critical failures stop pipeline execution
- **AND** warnings allow continued processing

#### Scenario: Validation reporting
- **WHEN** validation completes
- **THEN** detailed reports are generated
- **AND** results are stored for historical analysis
