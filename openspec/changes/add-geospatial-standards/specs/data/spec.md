## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Coordinate Reference System Standards
The system MUST enforce consistent coordinate reference systems for geospatial data storage and user interface display.

#### Scenario: Storage CRS enforcement
- **WHEN** storing geospatial data
- **THEN** all geometry columns use EPSG:4326 (WGS84) as the standard storage CRS
- **AND** SRID is explicitly set to 4326 in PostGIS geometry columns

#### Scenario: UI CRS transformation
- **WHEN** preparing data for web mapping interfaces
- **THEN** geometries are transformed to EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator) for optimal display
- **AND** coordinate transformations preserve spatial accuracy

#### Scenario: CRS validation
- **WHEN** processing geospatial data
- **THEN** CRS information is validated and corrected if necessary
- **AND** invalid or missing CRS data is flagged for manual review

### Requirement: Geometry Validation and Correction
The system MUST validate and correct geometry data to ensure spatial data integrity.

#### Scenario: Invalid geometry detection
- **WHEN** processing geometry data
- **THEN** invalid geometries (self-intersecting, degenerate) are detected
- **AND** validation errors are logged with specific geometry IDs

#### Scenario: Geometry correction
- **WHEN** minor geometry issues are found
- **THEN** geometries are automatically corrected using PostGIS ST_MakeValid
- **AND** correction operations are logged for audit trails

#### Scenario: Geometry validation reporting
- **WHEN** validating geometry datasets
- **THEN** a validation report is generated with pass/fail status
- **AND** includes counts of valid/invalid geometries and error types

### Requirement: CRS Transformation Utilities
The system MUST provide utilities for coordinate transformations between common CRS systems.

#### Scenario: DataFrame CRS transformation
- **WHEN** `aker_geo.crs.to_ui(gdf)` is called
- **THEN** the GeoDataFrame is transformed from storage CRS to UI CRS
- **AND** the resulting geometries are suitable for web mapping

#### Scenario: Storage CRS transformation
- **WHEN** `aker_geo.crs.to_storage(gdf)` is called
- **THEN** the GeoDataFrame is transformed to EPSG:4326 for storage
- **AND** spatial accuracy is preserved during transformation

#### Scenario: CRS metadata preservation
- **WHEN** transforming coordinate systems
- **THEN** original CRS information is preserved in metadata
- **AND** transformation parameters are logged for reproducibility

### Requirement: Spatial Data Integrity
The system MUST maintain spatial data integrity throughout the data pipeline.

#### Scenario: PostGIS geometry column validation
- **WHEN** inserting spatial data into PostGIS
- **THEN** geometry columns are validated for correct SRID and geometry type
- **AND** invalid spatial data is rejected with clear error messages

#### Scenario: Geometry type consistency
- **WHEN** processing spatial datasets
- **THEN** geometry types are consistent within each column
- **AND** mixed geometry types are flagged as validation errors

#### Scenario: Spatial reference consistency
- **WHEN** combining spatial datasets
- **THEN** all datasets use compatible coordinate reference systems
- **AND** automatic CRS alignment is performed when possible

### Requirement: Geospatial Data Processing
The system MUST support common geospatial data processing operations with proper CRS handling.

#### Scenario: Spatial joins and overlays
- **WHEN** performing spatial operations between datasets
- **THEN** coordinate systems are automatically aligned
- **AND** spatial operations use appropriate CRS for calculations

#### Scenario: Distance and area calculations
- **WHEN** calculating distances or areas
- **THEN** calculations use appropriate CRS for the intended purpose
- **AND** results include CRS metadata for result interpretation

#### Scenario: Geospatial data export
- **WHEN** exporting spatial data for external systems
- **THEN** appropriate CRS is used based on target system requirements
- **AND** CRS information is included in export metadata
