## Why
Our current specification library explains intended capabilities, but contributors still struggle to understand the shipped implementation, the rationale behind critical algorithms, and how analysts should operate the system day-to-day. We need a structured, enforceable documentation layer that connects specs to working code and supports onboarding, reviews, and compliance.

## What Changes
- Establish a curated knowledge base that documents every delivered capability: business objective, data pathways, workflows, validation steps, and runbooks.
- Introduce a governance gate that requires proposals and pull requests to spell out documentation impact alongside engineering tasks, with checklists reviewers must enforce.
- Expand code-level documentation standards so public modules, classes, and functions include intent-rich docstrings while complex logic carries inline rationale.
- Provide automation and templates (lint hooks, doc scaffolds) that keep the knowledge base and code commentary synchronized with change history.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `governance`, `core`
- Affected code: documentation templates in `docs/`, lint/config updates, developer tooling (pre-commit, CI), module docstrings and inline comments across `src/`
