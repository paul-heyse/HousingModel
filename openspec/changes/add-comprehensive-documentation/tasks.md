## 1. Knowledge Base Foundations
- [x] 1.1 Audit existing documentation, specs, and code comments; capture gaps for each capability.
- [x] 1.2 Design the knowledge base structure (navigation, templates, ownership) and bootstrap placeholder pages per capability.

## 2. Capability Documentation
- [x] 2.1 Author capability briefs covering objectives, architecture, workflows, and validation steps for the currently shipped modules.
- [x] 2.2 Publish analyst-oriented runbooks and troubleshooting guides linked from each capability brief.

## 3. Code Commentary Standards
- [x] 3.1 Add module/class/function docstrings that map core packages to specs and articulate intent, inputs, and outputs.
- [x] 3.2 Annotate complex algorithms, guardrails, and domain heuristics with inline rationale synced to supporting tests or analyses.

## 4. Governance & Tooling
- [x] 4.1 Update contribution guidelines and review checklists to enforce documentation gates for proposals and pull requests.
- [x] 4.2 Integrate lint/CI hooks that fail when required docstrings or knowledge base updates are missing, and document remediation steps.
