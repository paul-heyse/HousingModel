## Why

The repository has grown to 158+ Python files with multiple active changes and implemented features, but lacks cohesive organization, comprehensive documentation, and optimization opportunities. A systematic refactoring will improve maintainability, reduce technical debt, enhance developer experience, and ensure the codebase scales effectively as the project matures.

## What Changes

- **BREAKING**: Repository-wide refactoring and reorganization
- **Code Quality**: Fix import patterns, reduce duplication, improve error handling
- **Documentation**: Complete missing documentation, API references, and user guides
- **Architecture**: Consolidate modules, improve separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Optimize imports, caching, and database operations
- **Testing**: Enhance test coverage and add integration tests
- **Configuration**: Standardize environment management and settings
- **CI/CD**: Improve linting, type checking, and build processes

## Impact

- Affected specs: Updates to core, gui, portfolio, and other capability specs
- Affected code: All modules with improved organization and patterns
- Risk: Breaking changes require careful migration; extensive testing needed
- Migration: Existing APIs preserved; internal refactoring improves maintainability
- Dependencies: May require additional testing and documentation tools
