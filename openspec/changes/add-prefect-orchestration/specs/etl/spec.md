## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Prefect Project Structure
The system MUST provide a Prefect project structure with proper configuration and flow organization.

#### Scenario: Project initialization
- **WHEN** a new Prefect project is initialized
- **THEN** it creates a `flows/` directory with proper project structure
- **AND** includes `prefect.toml` configuration file
- **AND** sets up deployment configurations

#### Scenario: Flow discovery
- **WHEN** Prefect discovers flows in the project
- **THEN** it automatically detects and registers flows in the `flows/` directory
- **AND** provides proper flow naming and organization

### Requirement: ETL Flow Templates
The system MUST provide reusable flow templates for common ETL operations.

#### Scenario: Market data refresh flow
- **WHEN** `flows/refresh_market_data.py` is executed
- **THEN** it orchestrates data ingestion from external sources
- **AND** applies transformations to raw data
- **AND** stores processed data in the data lake
- **AND** handles errors gracefully with proper logging

#### Scenario: Market scoring flow
- **WHEN** `flows/score_all_markets.py` is executed
- **THEN** it loads market data from the data lake
- **AND** applies scoring algorithms using configured models
- **AND** stores scoring results with proper metadata
- **AND** exports results to configured destinations

#### Scenario: Flow composition
- **WHEN** complex workflows are needed
- **THEN** flows can be composed using Prefect's subflow mechanism
- **AND** dependencies between flows are properly managed

### Requirement: Configurable Scheduling
The system MUST support configurable scheduling for automated pipeline execution.

#### Scenario: Cron-based scheduling
- **WHEN** a flow is configured with cron scheduling
- **THEN** it executes according to the specified cron expression
- **AND** supports standard cron syntax (minute, hour, day, month, day of week)

#### Scenario: Interval-based scheduling
- **WHEN** a flow is configured with interval scheduling
- **THEN** it executes at regular intervals (e.g., every 30 minutes, daily)
- **AND** supports timedelta-based configuration

#### Scenario: Manual triggering
- **WHEN** a flow needs manual execution
- **THEN** it can be triggered via Prefect CLI or API
- **AND** supports parameter overrides for manual runs

### Requirement: State Persistence and Monitoring
The system MUST provide state persistence and flow run tracking.

#### Scenario: Flow state storage
- **WHEN** flows execute
- **THEN** their state is persisted to Prefect's backend
- **AND** includes start time, end time, and execution status
- **AND** tracks input parameters and results

#### Scenario: Error handling and retries
- **WHEN** a flow fails
- **THEN** the failure is recorded with detailed error information
- **AND** automatic retries are configured based on failure type
- **AND** failed runs can be manually retried or cancelled

#### Scenario: Flow run history
- **WHEN** viewing flow execution history
- **THEN** all past runs are accessible with full execution details
- **AND** includes performance metrics and resource usage
- **AND** supports filtering by status, time range, and parameters

### Requirement: Local Development Support
The system MUST support local development and testing of flows.

#### Scenario: Local flow execution
- **WHEN** developing flows locally
- **THEN** flows can be executed with `prefect flow run`
- **AND** uses local state storage for development
- **AND** provides detailed logging for debugging

#### Scenario: Flow testing
- **WHEN** testing flows
- **THEN** unit tests can mock Prefect dependencies
- **AND** integration tests can run flows end-to-end
- **AND** test environments use isolated state storage

#### Scenario: Development workflow
- **WHEN** developing new flows
- **THEN** changes can be tested locally before deployment
- **AND** flow registration happens automatically on deployment
- **AND** development and production environments are properly separated
