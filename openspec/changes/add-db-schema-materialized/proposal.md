## Why
The current database schema lacks materialized tables for complex analytical queries and lacks optimized views for common join operations. This results in slow query performance for business intelligence and reporting, requiring complex application-level joins and aggregations. Materialized tables and optimized views will enable efficient analytical queries and improve overall system performance.

## What Changes
- Create materialized tables for frequently queried analytical data with proper indexing.
- Implement database views for complex joins between related tables.
- Add foreign key constraints for referential integrity enforcement.
- Integrate Great Expectations checks for data type and range validation.
- Optimize table structures for analytical workloads with appropriate partitioning.

## Impact
- Affected specs: data/schema
- Affected code: Database migrations, table definitions, view creation, analytical queries.
